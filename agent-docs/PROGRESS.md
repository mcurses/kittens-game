# Kittens Game Rewrite — Progress Tracker

Last updated: 2026-04-01

---

## Maintenance Updates

- 2026-03-30: Fixed the missing Web UI trigger for the `HUNT` action by adding a hunt control to `ActionPanel`.
- 2026-03-30: Fixed `ActionPanel` action dispatch to use the current slot context, so non-default saves no longer post actions to the default slot.
- 2026-03-31: Fixed slot-aware action dispatch across client panels (`BuildingsPanel`, `JobsPanel`, `SciencePanel`, `WorkshopPanel`, `ReligionPanel`, `SpacePanel`, `DiplomacyPanel`, `TimePanel`) so actions in `?slot=<name>` mutate the selected save instead of the default slot.
